As a Shopify agency, your clients trust you to recommend the best solutions. When it comes to internationalization, more agencies are choosing LocaleFlow - and here's why.

## The Agency Challenge

Your clients want to sell internationally. They need:
- Professional translations across their entire store
- Automatic sync when products change
- SEO-optimized multilingual content
- Minimal ongoing maintenance

You need:
- Reliable solution that doesn't create support headaches
- Predictable client costs for easy quoting
- Time-efficient setup and management
- Revenue opportunity through referrals

## Why LocaleFlow Works for Agencies

### 1. Set Up Once, Run Forever

LocaleFlow's automatic sync means:
- New products are translated automatically
- Content updates trigger re-translation
- No monthly translation tasks for you or your client

This eliminates the ongoing "translation maintenance" service that creates overhead without profit.

### 2. Predictable Client Costs

Unlike apps that charge per word or auto-upgrade:
- Fixed monthly pricing
- No surprise charges
- Easy to include in client proposals
- No awkward "your bill tripled" conversations

### 3. Works with Complex Builds

Your clients aren't using vanilla themes. LocaleFlow handles:
- Custom theme sections
- Metafield-heavy product pages
- Metaobjects for structured content
- Third-party app integrations

### 4. Native Shopify Markets Integration

If you're setting up Shopify Markets for clients:
- LocaleFlow integrates seamlessly
- No duplicate functionality
- Currency, pricing, and translations work together

<FlowyTip pose="celebrating" title="Built for Agencies">
  LocaleFlow is designed with agencies in mind. Set it up once, earn recurring commissions, and let auto-sync eliminate ongoing maintenance headaches.
</FlowyTip>
