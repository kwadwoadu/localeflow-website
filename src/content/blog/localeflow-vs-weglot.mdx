Weglot is one of the most popular translation solutions on the Shopify App Store. But is it the right choice for your store? Let's compare Weglot with LocaleFlow to help you decide.

## Quick Overview

| Feature | LocaleFlow | Weglot |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Starting Price** | $9.99/month | $15/month |
| **Free Plan** | No (14-day trial) | Yes (limited) |
| **Word Limits** | No limits | Yes, per plan |
| **Languages (lowest paid)** | Unlimited | 1 language |

| **Auto-Upgrade Risk** | No | Yes |

## Pricing Deep Dive

### LocaleFlow Pricing

LocaleFlow offers straightforward pricing with no word limits or automatic upgrades:
- All translations included
- No per-word charges
- Predictable monthly costs

### Weglot Pricing

Weglot uses a tiered system based on word count and languages:
- Free: 1 language, 10,000 words
- Starter: $15/month - 1 language, 10,000 words
- Business: $29/month - 3 languages, 50,000 words
- Pro: $79/month - 5 languages, 200,000 words
- Advanced: $299/month - 10 languages

**Important:** Weglot automatically upgrades your plan when you exceed limits, which can lead to unexpected charges.

## Key Differences

### Word and Translation Limits

**LocaleFlow** doesn't impose word limits. Translate as much content as you need without worrying about hitting a ceiling.

**Weglot** limits translations by word count. Once you exceed your plan's limit, you're automatically upgraded to a more expensive tier.

### Pricing for Multiple Languages

If you need 5+ languages, the cost difference becomes significant:

| Languages | LocaleFlow | Weglot |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| 2 | ~$15/month | $29/month |
| 5 | ~$25/month | $79/month |
| 10 | ~$35/month | $299/month |

### Automatic Content Sync

**LocaleFlow** automatically detects and translates new content when products or pages are updated. Set it up once and let it run.

**Weglot** also offers automatic detection but may require more manual intervention for complex content structures.

### Metafield Translation

**LocaleFlow** excels at metafield and metaobject translation with granular field-level control.

**Weglot** supports metafield translation but with less customization.

**LocaleFlow:**
- Monthly: ~$25
- Annual: ~$300
