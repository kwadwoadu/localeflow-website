Weglot is one of the most popular translation solutions on the Shopify App Store. But is it the right choice for your store? Let's compare Weglot with LocaleFlow to help you decide.

## Quick Overview

| Feature | LocaleFlow | Weglot |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Pricing** | $150/month flat | From $15/month |
| **Free Demo** | Yes (real store content) | Yes (limited) |
| **Word Limits** | No limits | Yes, per plan |
| **Languages** | Unlimited | Tiered by plan |
| **Native Shopify Integration** | Yes | Yes |
| **Auto-Upgrade Risk** | No | Yes |

## Pricing Deep Dive

### LocaleFlow Pricing

LocaleFlow offers simple, flat pricing at **$150/month**:
- All translations included
- No per-word charges
- No language limits
- Predictable monthly costs

### Weglot Pricing

Weglot uses a tiered system based on word count and languages:
- Free: 1 language, 10,000 words
- Starter: $15/month - 1 language, 10,000 words
- Business: $29/month - 3 languages, 50,000 words
- Pro: $79/month - 5 languages, 200,000 words
- Advanced: $299/month - 10 languages

**Important:** Weglot automatically upgrades your plan when you exceed limits, which can lead to unexpected charges.

<FlowyTip pose="thinking" title="Watch Those Word Limits">
  Weglot's word-based pricing can surprise you! A typical Shopify store with 500 products easily hits 50,000+ words. Make sure to calculate your actual word count before committing.

## Key Differences

### Word and Translation Limits

**LocaleFlow** doesn't impose word limits. Translate as much content as you need without worrying about hitting a ceiling.

**Weglot** limits translations by word count. Once you exceed your plan's limit, you're automatically upgraded to a more expensive tier.

### Pricing for Multiple Languages

LocaleFlow's flat $150/month includes unlimited languages, making the comparison straightforward:

| Languages | LocaleFlow | Weglot |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| 2 | $150/month | $29/month |
| 5 | $150/month | $79/month |
| 10 | $150/month | $299/month |

While Weglot may seem cheaper for 1-2 languages, LocaleFlow includes unlimited translations with no word limits - making it more predictable for growing stores.

### Automatic Content Sync

**LocaleFlow** automatically detects and translates new content when products or pages are updated. Set it up once and let it run.

**Weglot** also offers automatic detection but may require more manual intervention for complex content structures.

### Metafield Translation

**LocaleFlow** excels at metafield and metaobject translation with granular field-level control.

**Weglot** supports metafield translation but with less customization.

## Feature Comparison

### What LocaleFlow Does Better

- **No word limits** - Translate freely without watching your usage
- **Predictable pricing** - Know exactly what you'll pay each month
- **Metafield control** - Choose exactly which fields to translate
- **Custom translation rules** - Use term blacklists and custom terms
- **No surprise upgrades** - Your plan won't change without your consent

### What Weglot Does Better

- **Visual editor** - Edit translations directly on your site preview
- **Brand guidelines AI** - Train the AI with your brand voice
- **Wider platform support** - Works beyond Shopify
- **Larger community** - More tutorials and resources available

## Real Cost Comparison

Let's calculate the annual cost for a typical store with 50,000 words and 5 languages:

**LocaleFlow:**
- Monthly: $150
- Annual: $1,800

**Weglot:**
- Monthly: $79 (Pro plan required)
- Annual: $948

For stores with simpler needs, Weglot may cost less. However, LocaleFlow's unlimited word counts and auto-sync often deliver better value for growing stores with frequently changing inventory.
