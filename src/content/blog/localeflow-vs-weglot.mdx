Weglot is one of the most popular translation solutions on the Shopify App Store. But is it the right choice for your store? Let's compare Weglot with LocaleFlow to help you decide.

## Quick Overview

| Feature | LocaleFlow | Weglot |
|---------|------------|--------|
| **Pricing** | $150/month flat | €15-€299/month |
| **Word Limits** | None | Yes - auto-upgrade if exceeded |
| **Languages** | Unlimited | 1-10 depending on plan |
| **5 Languages Cost** | $150/month | €79/month (200K word limit) |
| **10 Languages Cost** | $150/month | €299/month |
| **Surprise Bills** | Never | Yes - auto-upgrades |

## Pricing Deep Dive

### LocaleFlow Pricing

LocaleFlow offers simple, flat pricing at **$150/month** with everything included:
- AI-powered automatic translations
- Unlimited languages
- Unlimited words - translate your entire catalog
- Auto-sync when content changes
- Advanced metafield translation
- Custom term rules and blacklists
- Pricelist support with pretty pricing
- **No hidden fees, no surprises, ever**

### Weglot Pricing (Watch for Surprise Bills)

Weglot uses a tiered system based on word count and languages:

| Plan | Price | Languages | Word Limit |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Starter | €15/mo | 1 | 10,000 |
| Business | €29/mo | 3 | 50,000 |
| Pro | €79/mo | 5 | 200,000 |
| Advanced | €299/mo | 10 | 1,000,000 |

**The hidden trap:** Weglot automatically upgrades your plan when you exceed limits. Growing stores often get surprise bills when traffic or content increases.

<FlowyTip pose="thinking" title="Watch Those Word Limits">
  Weglot's word-based pricing can surprise you! A typical Shopify store with 500 products easily hits 50,000+ words. Make sure to calculate your actual word count before committing.

## Why LocaleFlow Wins for Growing Stores

### No Word Limits - Ever

With LocaleFlow, translate as much content as you need without worrying about hitting a ceiling. Add products, update descriptions, expand your catalog - your price stays the same.

With Weglot, exceed your word limit and you're automatically upgraded to a more expensive tier. No warning, just a higher bill.

### Predictable Pricing at Any Scale

| Your Needs | LocaleFlow | Weglot |
|------------|------------|--------|
| 2 languages | $150/month | €29/month (50K limit) |
| 5 languages | $150/month | €79/month (200K limit) |
| 10 languages | $150/month | €299/month |
| Growing store | $150/month | Keeps increasing |

LocaleFlow's flat pricing means your costs stay predictable as you grow. Weglot's tiered model means success = higher bills.
