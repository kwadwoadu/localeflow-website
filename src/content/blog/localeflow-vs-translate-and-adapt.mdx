Shopify's Translate & Adapt app is free and built by Shopify themselves. So why would you need LocaleFlow? Let's explore when the free option works and when you need something more powerful.

## Quick Overview

| Feature | LocaleFlow | Translate & Adapt |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Price** | $150/month | Free |
| **Auto-Translation Languages** | Unlimited | 2 languages only |
| **Translation Quality** | AI-powered | Google Translate only |
| **Auto-Sync** | Yes - instant | No - manual updates |
| **Custom Term Rules** | Yes | No |
| **Translation Blacklists** | Yes | No |
| **Metafield Control** | Field-level | Basic |
| **Pretty Pricing** | Yes | No |

## The Hidden Cost of "Free"

Translate & Adapt is free in price, but costly in other ways:

### Only 2 Languages for Auto-Translation

This is the dealbreaker. Want to sell in France, Germany, AND Spain? You can auto-translate two - the third requires manual translation for everything.

For growing stores, this limitation becomes a bottleneck fast.

### Google Translate Quality

Translate & Adapt uses Google Translate exclusively. While serviceable for basic content, it struggles with:
- Marketing copy that converts
- Brand voice consistency
- Product descriptions that sell
- Technical or specialized terminology

**LocaleFlow's AI-powered translation** produces more natural, context-aware results that actually sound like your brand.

### No Automatic Content Sync

Update a product description at 2am? With Translate & Adapt, you'll need to manually update every translation. With LocaleFlow, it happens automatically.

For stores with frequently changing inventory, this manual work adds up fast.

### No Custom Term Rules or Blacklists

With Translate & Adapt, you can't:
- Prevent your brand name from being translated
- Define custom translations for specific terms
- Protect product codes or SKUs from translation

**LocaleFlow gives you full control** with term rules and blacklists.

### Basic Metafield Support

Merchants report ongoing issues with metafield translation. LocaleFlow offers **field-level control** - choose exactly which fields to translate in each resource type.

## When Translate & Adapt Might Be Enough

The free app works if you:
- Only need 1-2 additional languages (and never plan to expand)
- Have a tiny, rarely-changing product catalog
- Accept Google Translate quality for all content
- Have time for manual translation updates
- Don't need custom term control

<FlowyTip pose="thinking" title="The 2-Language Wall">
  Translate & Adapt's biggest limitation is the 2-language cap. Planning to sell in France, Germany, AND Spain? One market gets left behind with manual-only translation.
</FlowyTip>

## What LocaleFlow Gives You

### Unlimited Languages with Auto-Translation

Expanding to 3, 5, or 10 markets? LocaleFlow translates them all automatically. No limits, no manual work for additional languages.

### AI-Powered Translation Quality

LocaleFlow uses modern AI that produces natural, context-aware translations. This matters for:
- Product descriptions that actually sell
- Brand voice consistency across markets
- Marketing copy that converts
- Technical content that makes sense

### Automatic Content Sync

Add a product at midnight? Update a description on Sunday? LocaleFlow translates it instantly. No manual intervention, no forgotten updates, no translation debt.

### Custom Term Rules & Blacklists

**Term rules:** Define exactly how "Premium" translates in French vs Spanish.
**Blacklists:** Protect your brand name, product codes, and technical terms from translation.

### Field-Level Metafield Control

Using complex product data? LocaleFlow lets you choose exactly which metafields get translated and which stay as-is. Perfect for Shopify Plus stores with custom storefronts.

### Pricelist Support with Pretty Pricing

Display clean, professional prices like $49.99 instead of awkward conversions like $47.83.

## When to Make the Switch

### You've Hit the 2-Language Limit

Planning your third market? That's the clear signal. LocaleFlow handles unlimited languages automatically.

### Manual Updates Are Eating Your Time

Spending hours updating translations after product changes? LocaleFlow's auto-sync eliminates this busywork.

### Google Translate Isn't Cutting It

Customers commenting on awkward translations? LocaleFlow's AI produces content that actually sounds professional.

### You Need Translation Control

Want to protect your brand name? Define custom terms? Control metafield translation? That's LocaleFlow territory.

**LocaleFlow** is the answer when you're ready to:
- Expand beyond 2 markets
- Stop wasting time on manual updates
- Present professional-quality translations
- Control exactly how your brand translates
- Scale internationally with confidence

The question isn't whether you can afford LocaleFlow. It's whether you can afford to limit your international growth with a free tool that can't keep up.
