Shopify's Translate & Adapt app is free and built by Shopify themselves. So why would you need LocaleFlow? Let's explore when the free option works and when you need something more powerful.

## Quick Overview

| Feature | LocaleFlow | Translate & Adapt |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **Price** | $150/month | Free |
| **Auto-Translation Languages** | Unlimited | 2 languages max |
| **Manual Translation** | Unlimited | Unlimited |
| **Translation Quality** | AI-powered | Google Translate only |
| **Auto-Sync on Content Changes** | Yes | No |
| **Metafield Translation** | Full control | Basic |
| **Image Localization** | Coming soon | No |

## What Translate & Adapt Does Well

Shopify's native app is a solid starting point:

- **Completely free** - No subscription fees or word limits
- **Side-by-side editor** - Easy to compare source and translated content
- **Native integration** - Built by Shopify, works seamlessly
- **URL translation** - Translates URL handles for SEO
- **100 million character limit** - Generous annual auto-translation quota

For stores just testing international waters with 1-2 languages, Translate & Adapt is a reasonable choice.

## Limitations of Translate & Adapt

Despite being free, Translate & Adapt has significant limitations:

### Only 2 Languages for Auto-Translation

This is the biggest constraint. If you want automatic translation for more than 2 languages, you'll need to translate everything manually or use another app.

### Google Translate Only

Translate & Adapt uses Google Translate exclusively. While serviceable, it's not as accurate as modern AI translation engines, especially for:
- Marketing copy
- Product descriptions
- Nuanced brand messaging

### No Automatic Content Sync

When you update a product or page, Translate & Adapt doesn't automatically update translations. You need to manually re-translate changed content.

### No Image Text Handling

Images containing text cannot be localized. This is a common need for:
- Size guides
- Feature graphics
- Promotional banners

### Limited Metafield Support

Merchants report ongoing issues with metafield translation, including inability to edit image URLs and ALT text properly.

## When Translate & Adapt is Enough

The free app works well if you:
- Only need 1-2 additional languages
- Have a small, rarely-changing product catalog
- Don't mind Google Translate quality
- Can manually update translations when content changes
- Don't need metafield translation control

## When to Upgrade to LocaleFlow

Consider LocaleFlow when you:

### Need More Than 2 Languages

Expanding to 3+ markets? LocaleFlow offers unlimited languages with automatic translation for all of them.

### Want Better Translation Quality

LocaleFlow uses AI translation that produces more natural, contextually-aware translations. This matters for:
- Conversion-focused product descriptions
- Brand voice consistency
- Technical or specialized content

### Have Frequently Changing Inventory

If you add/update products regularly, manual translation becomes a bottleneck. LocaleFlow's automatic sync means new content is translated immediately.

### Need Advanced Metafield Translation

Selling on Shopify Plus or using complex metaobject structures? LocaleFlow offers field-level translation control that Translate & Adapt lacks.

### Want Custom Translation Rules

LocaleFlow lets you:
- Create term blacklists (never translate your brand name)
- Define custom term translations per language
- Use custom prompts to guide AI translations

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Store, Testing Waters

**Store:** 50 products, English + Spanish
**Recommendation:** Start with Translate & Adapt

The free app is sufficient for testing international demand. Upgrade later if you see traction.

### Scenario 2: Growing Store, Multiple Markets

**Store:** 500 products, English + French + German + Spanish
**Recommendation:** LocaleFlow

At 4 languages, Translate & Adapt's 2-language limit means 50% manual translation. LocaleFlow handles all languages automatically.

### Scenario 3: Fast-Moving Inventory

**Store:** 1000+ products, weekly additions, 3 languages
**Recommendation:** LocaleFlow

Manually translating new products every week isn't sustainable. LocaleFlow's auto-sync keeps everything current.

### Scenario 4: Premium Brand, Quality Critical

**Store:** Luxury goods, 2 languages
**Recommendation:** LocaleFlow

Even with just 2 languages, the AI translation quality difference matters for premium positioning.

## Migration Path

Many stores start with Translate & Adapt and upgrade later. The migration is smooth:

1. Install LocaleFlow alongside Translate & Adapt
2. Configure your languages and preferences
3. Let LocaleFlow enhance/replace translations
4. Keep Translate & Adapt's manual translations as a base
5. Uninstall Translate & Adapt when ready

Your existing translations are preserved in Shopify's translation system - LocaleFlow builds on them.

## Conclusion

**Translate & Adapt** is a great free starting point for stores testing 1-2 languages with stable inventory.

**LocaleFlow** is the upgrade when you need:
- More than 2 auto-translated languages
- Better translation quality
- Automatic content sync
- Advanced metafield control

The $150/month investment pays for itself when you consider the time saved on manual translations and the revenue from better international conversions.
