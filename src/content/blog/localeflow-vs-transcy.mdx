| **Auto-Sync** | Yes - instant | Varies by plan |

## Pricing Comparison

### LocaleFlow Pricing

LocaleFlow offers simple, flat pricing at **$150/month** with everything included:
- AI-powered automatic translations
- Unlimited languages
- Unlimited words
- Auto-sync when content changes
- Advanced metafield translation with field-level control
- Custom term rules and blacklists
- Pricelist support with pretty pricing (intelligent rounding)
- Native Shopify Markets integration
- **No hidden fees, no tiered complexity**

### Transcy Pricing

Transcy uses a tiered model:

| Plan | Price | What You Get |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Free | $0 | 1 language, 1 currency only |
| Basic | $11.90/mo | 2 languages |
| Growth | $29.90/mo | 111 languages |
| Premium | $59.90/mo | All features + success manager |

**Note:** Transcy updated pricing in September 2025. The tiered model means you pay more as you need more features.

## Why LocaleFlow Excels for Shopify Stores

### Translation Excellence

LocaleFlow uses AI-powered translation for high-quality, context-aware results. But what sets it apart is the control:

- **Custom term rules** - Define how specific terms translate in each language
- **Blacklists** - Prevent brand names, product codes, or technical terms from being translated
- **Custom prompts** - Guide the AI for your brand voice

### Automatic Content Sync

Add a product at midnight? LocaleFlow translates it automatically. Update a description? Translations sync instantly. No manual work, no delays, no missed content.

### Advanced Metafield Translation

This is where LocaleFlow truly shines. Get **field-level control** for metafields and metaobjects:
- Choose exactly which fields to translate
- Skip fields that shouldn't be translated (like SKUs)
- Handle complex product data with precision

### Pricelist Support with Pretty Pricing

LocaleFlow includes intelligent price rounding. Instead of awkward prices like $47.83, show customers clean prices like $47.99 or $48.00.

### Native Shopify Markets Integration

LocaleFlow works seamlessly with Shopify Markets - the platform Shopify built for international selling. This means:
- Native currency handling
- Proper localization structure
- Future-proof architecture

<FlowyTip pose="thumbsup" title="Already on Shopify Markets?">
  If you're using Shopify Markets (and you should be), LocaleFlow integrates perfectly. You get the best of both worlds - Shopify's localization infrastructure plus LocaleFlow's translation excellence.

## LocaleFlow vs Transcy: Key Differentiators

| Capability | LocaleFlow | Transcy |
|------------|------------|---------|
| **Custom term rules** | Full control per language | Limited |
| **Translation blacklists** | Yes | No |
| **Metafield control** | Field-level precision | Basic |
| **Pretty pricing** | Yes (intelligent rounding) | No |
| **Auto-sync** | Instant | Varies |
| **Shopify Markets** | Native integration | Separate |

### What About Transcy's Bundled Features?

Transcy bundles currency conversion and geolocation. But if you're on Shopify Markets (which Shopify recommends for international selling), you already have these features built-in.

With LocaleFlow + Shopify Markets, you get:
- Currency handled natively by Shopify
- Geolocation through Shopify Markets
- Best-in-class translation from LocaleFlow

**The result:** A cleaner, more focused solution rather than feature overlap.

## Who Should Choose LocaleFlow?

LocaleFlow is the right choice if you:
- Use (or plan to use) Shopify Markets
- Want maximum control over your translations
- Need advanced metafield translation with field-level precision
- Value custom term rules and blacklists
- Want pricelist support with intelligent rounding
- Prefer a focused tool that does translation excellently

### When Transcy Might Work

Transcy could be sufficient if you:
- Aren't using Shopify Markets and need bundled currency
- Want translation + currency in one app
- Have basic translation needs without custom rules
- Are comfortable with tiered pricing

## Cost Analysis

| What You Need | LocaleFlow | Transcy |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Full features | $150/month | $59.90/month (Premium) |
| 5+ languages | $150/month | $29.90/month (Growth) |
| Annual cost (full) | $1,800 | $718.80 |

**But consider what you get:**

LocaleFlow's $150/month includes:
- Custom term rules (Transcy: limited)
- Translation blacklists (Transcy: no)
- Field-level metafield control (Transcy: basic)
- Pretty pricing/pricelist support (Transcy: no)
- Native Shopify Markets integration

**For serious international sellers, LocaleFlow's advanced features justify the investment.**

## Switching to LocaleFlow

1. Install LocaleFlow from the Shopify App Store
2. Configure your languages and translation preferences
3. Set up your custom term rules and blacklists
4. Run initial translation
5. Review and refine using field-level controls
