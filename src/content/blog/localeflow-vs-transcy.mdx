## Pricing Comparison

### LocaleFlow Pricing

LocaleFlow focuses on translation with straightforward pricing:
- Essential features from $9.99/month
- No word or page limits
- All translation engines included

### Transcy Pricing

Transcy offers tiered plans with bundled features:
- Free: 1 language, 1 currency
- Basic: $11.90/month - 2 languages
- Growth: $29.90/month - 111 languages, 167 currencies
- Premium: $59.90/month - All features + customer success manager

**Note:** Transcy announced pricing changes effective September 2025, so costs may increase.

## Core Feature Comparison

### Translation Quality

**LocaleFlow** uses advanced AI engines including GPT models for high-quality, context-aware translations. Custom prompts and term rules let you fine-tune output.

**Transcy** also supports multiple engines (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepL, Baidu, Yandex). Both offer comparable translation quality.

### Currency Conversion

**LocaleFlow** relies on Shopify Markets for currency handling. This means native integration but requires Markets configuration.

**Transcy** includes a built-in currency converter with:
- Real-time conversion rates
- Custom rate adjustments
- Price display customization
- Geolocation-based currency selection

If you're not using Shopify Markets, Transcy's bundled currency features are convenient.

### Content Sync

**LocaleFlow** automatically detects and translates new content as it's added. Update a product, and the translation updates too.

**Transcy** also offers automatic translation with no word or pageview limits on paid plans.

### Image Translation

**Transcy** has an advantage here with AI-powered image text translation - it can detect and translate text within images.

**LocaleFlow** is developing image localization features (coming soon).

### Metafield Translation

**LocaleFlow** offers granular field-level control for metafields and metaobjects. Choose exactly which fields to translate.

**Transcy** supports metafield translation but with less granular control.

## Unique Strengths

### LocaleFlow Strengths

- **Custom translation rules** - Blacklists, custom terms, and prompts
- **Pricelist support** - Translate prices with pretty pricing (rounding)
- **Metafield control** - Field-level translation selection
- **Shopify Markets native** - Deep integration with Shopify's localization system
- **Simpler focus** - Does one thing (translation) excellently

### Transcy Strengths

- **All-in-one solution** - Translation + currency in one app
- **Image text translation** - AI-powered image localization
- **Geolocation built-in** - Auto-detect visitor location
- **Currency customization** - Detailed price display options
- **Free tier** - Try before you buy

## Who Should Choose Which?

### Choose LocaleFlow if you:

- Use Shopify Markets for currency/localization
- Want maximum control over translations
- Need advanced metafield translation
- Prefer focused, specialized tools
- Value custom translation rules

### Choose Transcy if you:

- Don't use Shopify Markets and need currency conversion
- Want translation + currency in one app
- Need image text translation
- Prefer an all-in-one solution
- Want to start with a free tier

## Integration Considerations

### Shopify Markets Users

If you're on Shopify Markets for international selling, LocaleFlow integrates seamlessly. Transcy works too but has overlapping features.

### Non-Markets Users

If you're not using Shopify Markets, Transcy's bundled currency converter adds value. With LocaleFlow, you'd handle currency separately.

## Cost Analysis

For a typical store needing 5 languages:

**LocaleFlow:**
- ~$25/month
- $300/year

**Transcy (Growth plan required for 5+ languages):**
- $29.90/month
- $358.80/year

Similar pricing, but the feature sets differ. Choose based on which features you need.

## Switching Between Apps

### From Transcy to LocaleFlow

1. Install LocaleFlow from the Shopify App Store
2. Configure languages and translation preferences
3. Run initial translation
4. Review and customize
5. Remove Transcy when ready

### From LocaleFlow to Transcy

Same process in reverse. Both apps work with Shopify's translation system, so switching is straightforward.

## Conclusion

**Transcy** is ideal for stores wanting an all-in-one translation and currency solution, especially those not on Shopify Markets.

**LocaleFlow** is best for stores that:
- Already use Shopify Markets
- Want focused translation excellence
- Need granular control over metafields and translation rules
- Prefer specialized tools over bundled solutions

Both are capable apps. Your choice depends on whether you need bundled currency features (Transcy) or focused translation power (LocaleFlow).
