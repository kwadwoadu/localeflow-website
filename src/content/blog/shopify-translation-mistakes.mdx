Expanding internationally is exciting, but poor translations can hurt more than help. Here are the five most common translation mistakes Shopify merchants make - and how to avoid them.

## Mistake 1: Translating Everything Literally

The most common mistake is treating translation as a word-for-word conversion.

### The Problem

Literal translation ignores:
- Cultural context
- Idioms and expressions
- Marketing effectiveness
- Regional preferences

### Example

**English:** "Our sale is going bananas!"

**Literal German:** "Unser Verkauf geht Bananen!" (Makes no sense)

**Better German:** "Unser Sale ist der Wahnsinn!" (Captures the excitement)

### How to Fix It

1. Use AI translation engines that understand context (not just word substitution)
2. Review marketing copy manually
3. Test translations with native speakers
4. Consider hiring local copywriters for key pages

LocaleFlow's AI translation understands context, but you should still review marketing headlines.

## Mistake 2: Ignoring SEO in Translations

Many merchants translate content but forget about search visibility.

### The Problem

If your translated pages aren't optimized:
- They won't rank in local search engines
- International customers can't find you
- You miss organic traffic opportunities

### What Gets Missed

- Meta titles and descriptions
- URL slugs
- Image alt text
- Header tags
- Structured data

### How to Fix It

1. **Translate meta content** - Don't skip meta titles and descriptions
2. **Localize URLs** - Use translated URL handles when possible
3. **Add hreflang tags** - LocaleFlow handles this automatically
4. **Research local keywords** - The #1 keyword in English might differ in German

### Example

**English keyword:** "running shoes"
**German keyword:** "Laufschuhe" (not "rennende Schuhe")

A literal translation would miss what Germans actually search for.

## Mistake 3: Not Translating Metafields

Metafields contain critical product information that often gets overlooked.

### The Problem

Shopify themes increasingly use metafields for:
- Size guides
- Care instructions
- Material details
- Custom product attributes

If these aren't translated, customers see a mix of languages on product pages.

### What to Translate

- Product metafields (specs, materials, dimensions)
- Metaobjects (size charts, ingredient lists)
- Theme settings that use metafields
- Custom sections and blocks

### How to Fix It

Use a translation app that supports metafield translation with field-level control. LocaleFlow lets you:
- See all metafields in your store
- Choose exactly which fields to translate
- Exclude technical fields that shouldn't change

## Mistake 4: Forgetting the Customer Journey

Translation isn't just about product pages.

### The Problem

Merchants often translate products but forget:
- Cart and checkout
- Email notifications
- Account pages
- Support content
- Policies and legal pages

This creates a jarring experience where the language switches mid-purchase.

### The Full Customer Journey

1. **Discovery** - Blog posts, collection pages
2. **Product pages** - Descriptions, reviews
3. **Cart** - Messages, upsells
4. **Checkout** - Forms, shipping options
5. **Post-purchase** - Order emails, tracking
6. **Support** - FAQ, contact pages, policies

### How to Fix It

Audit your entire store from a customer perspective:

1. Start at the homepage
2. Browse collections
3. Add items to cart
4. Go through checkout (use test mode)
5. Check email notifications
6. Visit support/policy pages

Note any untranslated elements and address them.

## Mistake 5: Set and Forget Mentality

Translation isn't a one-time task.

### The Problem

Stores evolve. You add:
- New products
- Updated descriptions
- Seasonal collections
- New blog posts
- Changed policies

If translations aren't maintained, new content appears in the wrong language.

### Signs of Outdated Translations

- New products showing in original language
- Inconsistent language across collections
- Missing translations on recently added pages
- Customer complaints about mixed languages

### How to Fix It

1. **Enable automatic sync** - LocaleFlow translates new content automatically
2. **Review monthly** - Check a sample of recent products
3. **Monitor analytics** - Watch international conversion rates
4. **Gather feedback** - Ask international customers about language issues

## Conclusion

2. **Optimize for local SEO** - Translate metadata and URLs
