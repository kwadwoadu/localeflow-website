Choosing the right translation app for your Shopify store is crucial for international success. In this comparison, we'll look at LocaleFlow and Langify - two popular options for multilingual Shopify stores.

## Quick Overview

| Feature | LocaleFlow | Langify |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Pricing** | $150/month | $17.50/month |
| **Free Demo** | Yes (real store content) | 7 days |
| **Auto-Translation** | Included (AI-powered) | Optional add-on ($4.99+) |
| **Languages** | Unlimited | Up to 20 |
| **Auto-Sync** | Yes | No |
| **Metafield Translation** | Yes | Limited |

## Pricing Comparison

### LocaleFlow Pricing

LocaleFlow offers simple, flat pricing at **$150/month** with automatic AI-powered translations included. There are no word limits, no language limits, and no hidden fees.

### Langify Pricing

Langify charges a flat rate of **$17.50/month** for their core app. However, automatic translations are sold as separate add-on packages:
- 10,000 words: $4.99
- 20,000 words: $8.99
- 50,000 words: $19.90

This means a store needing regular translations could end up paying significantly more with Langify.

## Feature Comparison

### Automatic Translation

**LocaleFlow** includes AI-powered automatic translation. When you add or update content, translations are generated automatically. You can also customize translations with your own term rules and blacklists.

**Langify** focuses on manual translation by default. Automatic translation requires purchasing word packages, which can add up for stores with frequently changing inventory.

### Content Sync

**LocaleFlow** automatically detects and translates new content as it's added to your store. Change a product description? The translation updates automatically.

**Langify** requires manual intervention to update translations when source content changes.

### Metafield & Metaobject Support

**LocaleFlow** offers comprehensive metafield and metaobject translation with field-level control. Choose exactly which fields to translate in each resource type.

**Langify** has limited metafield support compared to LocaleFlow.

### SEO Features

Both apps support essential SEO features:
- Hreflang tags
- Translated URLs
- Meta tag translation
- Image alt text translation

## Pros and Cons

### LocaleFlow

**Pros:**
- Lower starting price with translations included
- Automatic content sync when changes occur
- Advanced metafield translation
- Custom term rules and blacklists
- Pricelist support with pretty pricing

**Cons:**
- Newer to the market

### Langify

**Pros:**
- Established since 2014
- Full manual control over translations
- CSV/PO file export for professional translators
- Good for highly curated content

**Cons:**

## Who Should Choose Which?

### Choose LocaleFlow if you:
- Have frequently changing inventory

### Choose Langify if you:

3. Let LocaleFlow auto-translate your content
4. Review and customize translations
5. Uninstall Langify when ready

## Conclusion

Both LocaleFlow and Langify are capable translation apps, but they serve different needs:

- **LocaleFlow** is ideal for stores wanting automated, hands-off translation with modern features and predictable pricing.
- **Langify** suits stores requiring manual control and integration with professional translation workflows.

For most Shopify merchants looking to expand internationally with minimal effort, LocaleFlow's automatic sync and included AI translations make it the more practical choice.
