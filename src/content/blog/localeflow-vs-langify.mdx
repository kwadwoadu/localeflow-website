Choosing the right translation app for your Shopify store is crucial for international success. In this comparison, we'll look at LocaleFlow and Langify - two popular options for multilingual Shopify stores.

## Quick Overview

| Feature | LocaleFlow | Langify |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Base Price** | $150/month | $17.50/month |
| **Auto-Translation** | Included | Add-on: $4.99-$19.90 per package |
| **Real Monthly Cost** | $150 (flat) | $30-$70+ (with translations) |
| **Languages** | Unlimited | Up to 20 |
| **Auto-Sync** | Yes | No |
| **Hidden Fees** | None | Word package add-ons |

<FlowyTip pose="thinking" title="Quick Decision Guide">
  If your catalog changes frequently and you want hands-off automation, LocaleFlow is your best bet. If you need pixel-perfect manual control with professional translators, Langify might suit you better.

## Pricing Comparison

### LocaleFlow Pricing

LocaleFlow offers simple, flat pricing at **$150/month** with everything included:
- AI-powered automatic translations
- Unlimited languages
- Unlimited words
- Auto-sync when content changes
- No hidden fees or add-ons

### Langify Pricing (The Real Cost)

Langify's advertised price of **$17.50/month** is just the starting point. Here's what you'll actually pay:

| Langify Item | Cost |
|--------------|------|
| Basic plan | $17.50/mo |
| Growth plan | $29.95/mo |
| Auto-translate 10,000 words | +$4.99 |
| Auto-translate 20,000 words | +$8.99 |
| Auto-translate 50,000 words | +$19.90 |

**The catch:** Auto-translation is NOT included - it's sold as separate word packages that you buy repeatedly.

For a typical active store, you're looking at **$30-$70+/month** once you add the translations you actually need.

<FlowyTip pose="thinking" title="Do the Math">
  A store with 500 products updating weekly could easily burn through 20,000+ words per month. At Langify, that's $17.50 + $8.99 = $26.49 minimum - and it only goes up from there.

## Feature Comparison

### Automatic Translation

**LocaleFlow** includes AI-powered automatic translation. When you add or update content, translations are generated automatically. You can also customize translations with your own term rules and blacklists.

**Langify** focuses on manual translation by default. Automatic translation requires purchasing word packages, which can add up for stores with frequently changing inventory.

### Content Sync

**LocaleFlow** automatically detects and translates new content as it's added to your store. Change a product description? The translation updates automatically.

**Langify** requires manual intervention to update translations when source content changes.

### Metafield & Metaobject Support

**LocaleFlow** offers comprehensive metafield and metaobject translation with field-level control. Choose exactly which fields to translate in each resource type.

**Langify** has limited metafield support compared to LocaleFlow.

### SEO Features

Both apps support essential SEO features:
- Hreflang tags
- Translated URLs
- Meta tag translation
- Image alt text translation

## Pros and Cons

- Advanced metafield translation
- Custom term rules and blacklists

### Langify

**Pros:**
- Established since 2014
- Full manual control over translations
