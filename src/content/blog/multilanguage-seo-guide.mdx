Translating your Shopify store is just the first step. To capture international organic traffic, you need proper multi-language SEO. This guide covers everything you need to know.

## Why Multi-Language SEO Matters

Consider this: 75% of consumers prefer to buy products in their native language, and 60% rarely or never buy from English-only websites.

Without proper SEO:
- Your translated pages won't rank
- International customers can't find you
- You miss organic traffic from other markets
- Paid advertising becomes your only option

## The Technical Foundation

### Hreflang Tags

Hreflang tags tell search engines which language version of a page to show to which users.

```html
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="en" href="https://store.com/products/shoes" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="de" href="https://store.com/de/products/schuhe" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="fr" href="https://store.com/fr/products/chaussures" />
<link rel="alternate" hreflang="x-default" href="https://store.com/products/shoes" />
```

**Good news:** LocaleFlow and Shopify Markets handle hreflang tags automatically. You don't need to add them manually.

### URL Structure Options

There are three main approaches:

**1. Subdirectories (Recommended for Shopify)**
```
store.com/products/shoes
store.com/de/products/schuhe
store.com/fr/products/chaussures
```

**2. Subdomains**
```
store.com
de.store.com
fr.store.com
```

**3. Country-Code TLDs**
```
store.com
store.de
store.fr
```

Shopify uses subdirectories by default with Markets. This works well for most stores.

### URL Handle Translation

Translate your URL handles for better local SEO:

| Language | URL |
|----------|-----|
| English | /products/running-shoes |
| German | /products/laufschuhe |
| French | /products/chaussures-de-course |

LocaleFlow and Shopify handle URL translation. In Shopify's translation editor, you can customize the URL handle per language.

## Content Optimization

### Keyword Research Per Market

The same product might have different keywords in different languages.

**Example: "laptop bag"**
- German: "Laptoptasche" (most searched) vs "Notebooktasche"
- French: "Sacoche pour ordinateur portable" vs "Housse PC"
- Spanish: "Bolsa para laptop" vs "Maletín portátil"

**How to research:**
1. Use local Google (google.de, google.fr, etc.)
2. Try Google Keyword Planner with location targeting
3. Check local competitor sites
4. Use tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush with country filters

### Meta Title Optimization

Each language needs optimized meta titles:

**English:** "Running Shoes for Men | Free Shipping | YourStore"
**German:** "Laufschuhe für Herren | Kostenloser Versand | YourStore"
**French:** "Chaussures de Course Homme | Livraison Gratuite | YourStore"

**Best practices:**
- Keep under 60 characters
- Include primary keyword
- Add your brand name
- Consider local search behavior

### Meta Descriptions

**English (155 chars):**
"Shop our collection of men's running shoes. Premium cushioning, breathable materials. Free shipping on orders over $50. Find your perfect fit today."

**German (155 chars):**
"Entdecken Sie unsere Laufschuhe für Herren. Premium-Dämpfung, atmungsaktive Materialien. Kostenloser Versand ab 50€. Jetzt bestellen."

LocaleFlow translates meta descriptions automatically, but review them for keyword optimization.

## Image SEO

### Alt Text Translation

Alt text serves two purposes:
1. Accessibility for screen readers
2. SEO ranking signals

**English alt:** "Red Nike running shoes for men - side view"
**German alt:** "Rote Nike Laufschuhe für Herren - Seitenansicht"

Make sure your translation app handles image alt text. LocaleFlow includes this automatically.

### Image File Names

If possible, use descriptive file names:
- `red-running-shoes.jpg` (English)
- `rote-laufschuhe.jpg` (German)

Note: Shopify makes this difficult for product images, but it works for theme assets and custom images.

## Schema Markup

Structured data helps search engines understand your content.

### Product Schema

Your product pages should include translated:
- Product name
- Description
- Brand name (if translated)
- Price in local currency

Shopify handles basic product schema. LocaleFlow ensures translations appear in the schema.

### Breadcrumb Schema

```json
{
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {"name": "Home", "item": "https://store.com/de"},
    {"name": "Damen", "item": "https://store.com/de/collections/damen"},
    {"name": "Laufschuhe", "item": "https://store.com/de/collections/damen/laufschuhe"}
  ]
}
```

## Common Multi-Language SEO Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Automatic Redirects Based on IP

Don't force users to a language version based on their location. Google needs to access all versions from any location.

**Instead:** Show a language selector and let users choose.

### Mistake 2: Duplicate Content Across Languages

Each language version must be complete. Don't:
- Leave parts untranslated
- Show the same content on different language URLs
- Use machine translation without review for key pages

### Mistake 3: Ignoring Local Search Engines

While Google dominates globally, don't forget:
- Yandex (Russia)
- Baidu (China)
- Naver (South Korea)

If targeting these markets, research their specific requirements.

### Mistake 4: Poor Mobile Experience

Many international markets are mobile-first. Ensure:
- Language selector works on mobile
- Translated content doesn't break layouts
- Page speed is fast globally (use a CDN)

## Measuring International SEO Success

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Organic traffic by country** - Google Analytics geographic data
2. **Keyword rankings per market** - Use local rank tracking
3. **Click-through rate by language** - Search Console data
4. **Conversion rate by market** - Revenue per visitor

### Google Search Console Setup

Set up separate Search Console properties for:
- Main domain (all languages)
- Each market or language subdirectory

This gives you detailed insights per market.

<FlowyTip pose="thinking" title="Local Keywords Matter">
  Don't just translate your English keywords word-for-word. "Running shoes" might be the top term in English, but Germans search for "Laufschuhe" - research each market!
</FlowyTip>
