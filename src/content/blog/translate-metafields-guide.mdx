Metafields are essential for modern Shopify stores. They store product specifications, size guides, care instructions, and custom attributes. But many merchants overlook metafield translation - leaving international customers with a mix of languages on product pages.

## What Are Metafields?

Metafields are custom data fields in Shopify. They extend what you can store about products, collections, customers, and more.

Common metafield uses:
- Product specifications (weight, dimensions)
- Materials and ingredients
- Care instructions
- Size guides
- Custom attributes for filtering
- Technical specifications

## Why Metafield Translation Matters

Consider a German customer viewing your product page:
- Product title: German
- Description: German
- "Material: 100% Cotton" (metafield): English

This inconsistency hurts:
- **User experience** - Jarring language switches
- **Trust** - Looks unprofessional
- **Conversions** - Customers may not understand key info
- **SEO** - Mixed language content confuses search engines

## Types of Metafields to Translate

### Product Metafields

The most common type:
- Material composition
- Care instructions
- Dimensions and specifications
- Features and benefits
- Warranty information

### Collection Metafields

- Collection descriptions
- Filter labels
- Featured content

### Metaobjects

Shopify's newer feature for structured data:
- Size guides
- Ingredient lists
- Color swatches with names
- FAQ entries
- Store locations

## Setting Up Metafield Translation in LocaleFlow

LocaleFlow provides field-level control over metafield translation.

### Step 1: Access Metafield Settings

1. Open LocaleFlow in your Shopify admin
2. Go to Translation Settings
3. Find the Metafields section

### Step 2: View Your Metafields

LocaleFlow automatically discovers your store's metafields:
- Namespace and key
- Field type (text, rich text, list, etc.)
- Where it's used (products, collections, etc.)

### Step 3: Select Fields to Translate

For each metafield, decide:
- **Translate**: Customer-facing text fields
- **Don't translate**: Technical values, codes, measurements

#### Fields to Translate:

| Metafield | Translate? |
|-----------|------------|
| `custom.material_description` | Yes |
| `custom.care_instructions` | Yes |
| `custom.feature_list` | Yes |
| `custom.size_guide_text` | Yes |

#### Fields NOT to Translate:

| Metafield | Translate? |
|-----------|------------|
| `custom.sku_suffix` | No |
| `custom.weight_grams` | No |
| `custom.color_hex` | No |
| `custom.internal_notes` | No |

### Step 4: Run Translation

Once configured, LocaleFlow:
1. Fetches translatable metafield content
2. Translates using AI
3. Stores translations in Shopify's system
4. Auto-syncs when content changes

## Translating Metaobjects

Metaobjects require similar attention.

### Example: Size Guide Metaobject

Your size guide might have:
- Header text
- Size names (S, M, L, XL)
- Measurement labels (Chest, Waist, Hips)
- Fit descriptions

**Which to translate:**
- Header text: Yes
- Measurement labels: Yes
- Fit descriptions: Yes
- Size names: Sometimes (S/M/L are often universal)
- Numeric measurements: No

### Example: FAQ Metaobject

For FAQ entries:
- Question text: Translate
- Answer text: Translate
- Category label: Translate
- Internal ID: Don't translate

## Field-Level Control

LocaleFlow lets you be specific about what gets translated.

### Rich Text Fields

For metafields containing formatted content:
- The full content is translated
- Formatting (bold, lists, links) is preserved
- HTML structure stays intact

### List Fields

For metafields with multiple values:
- Each list item is translated individually
- Order is preserved
- Empty items are skipped

### Single-Line Text

Standard text fields:
- Full value is translated
- Leading/trailing spaces preserved

## Best Practices

### 1. Audit Before Translating

Before enabling translation:
1. List all metafields in use
2. Identify customer-facing vs. internal
3. Note any that should stay in original language

### 2. Use Consistent Naming

Organize metafields with clear namespaces:
- `translate.material` (should be translated)
- `internal.sku_code` (should not)

This makes bulk configuration easier.

### 3. Review Technical Content

Some content looks translatable but shouldn't be:
- Model numbers
- Certification codes (CE, UL, etc.)
- Color codes
- SKUs

### 4. Test with Real Products

After configuration:
1. Check a product page in each language
2. Verify metafield content displays correctly
3. Ensure no mixed languages

### 5. Handle Edge Cases

**Brand names in metafields:**
- Add to translation blacklist
- They should stay unchanged

**Measurement units:**
- Consider localizing (cm vs. inches)
- Or keep consistent across markets

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Metafield Not Appearing in Translation

**Cause:** Field type might not be translatable (e.g., boolean, date)

**Solution:** Only text-type metafields can be translated. For complex types, ensure the text portion is properly configured.

### Issue: HTML Breaking in Rich Text

**Cause:** Translation sometimes alters HTML structure

**Solution:** LocaleFlow preserves HTML structure. If issues occur, check the source content for unusual formatting.

### Issue: List Items Merging

**Cause:** Some list metafields use special separators

**Solution:** Verify the metafield is defined as a list type in Shopify, not a single text field with manual separators.

## Metaobjects for Multilingual Stores

### When to Use Metaobjects

Metaobjects are ideal for:
- Content that repeats across products (size guides)
- Structured data (ingredient lists)
- Reference data (color names)

### Translation Approach

1. Create the metaobject in your default language
2. Let LocaleFlow translate all text fields
3. Review and adjust as needed

### Example: Color Swatch Metaobject

Original (English):
```
Name: "Forest Green"
Description: "A deep, natural green inspired by nature"
Hex: "#228B22"
```

Translated (German):
```
Name: "Waldgrün"
Description: "Ein tiefes, natürliches Grün inspiriert von der Natur"
Hex: "#228B22" (unchanged)
```

## Checking Your Work

### Manual Review

For each language, check:
1. Product pages with metafields
2. Collection pages with metafield filters
3. Any pages using metaobjects
4. Theme sections pulling metafield data

### Customer Feedback

International customers will tell you if something's wrong. Monitor:
- Support tickets about language issues
- Reviews mentioning translation problems
- Cart abandonment on international pages

## Conclusion

Metafield translation is crucial for a fully localized store. Key takeaways:

1. **Audit your metafields** - Know what you have
2. **Classify each field** - Translate vs. don't translate
3. **Use field-level control** - LocaleFlow lets you be specific
4. **Include metaobjects** - Don't forget structured data
5. **Test thoroughly** - Check every product page

With LocaleFlow, metafield translation is:
- Automatic for configured fields
- Synced when content changes
- Granular enough for complex stores
